FAQ
Can I access the contents of a private profile? No, you cannot get information on private profiles. You can only get information from a public profile or a profile you follow. The tools that claim to be successful are scams!
What is and how I can bypass the challenge_required error? The challenge_required error means that Instagram notice a suspicious behavior on your profile, so needs to check if you are a real person or a bot. To avoid this you should follow the suggested link and complete the required operation (insert a code, confirm email, etc)
Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
Fork/Clone/Download this repo

git clone https://github.com/Datalux/Osintgram.git

Navigate to the directory

cd Osintgram

Create a virtual environment for this project

python3 -m venv venv

Load the virtual environment

On Windows Powershell: .\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
On Linux and Git Bash: source venv/bin/activate
Run pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the credentials.ini file in the config folder and write your Instagram account username and password in the corresponding fields

Alternatively, you can run the make setup command to populate this file for you.

Run the main.py script in one of two ways

As an interactive prompt python3 main.py <target username>
Or execute your command straight away python3 main.py <target username> --command <command>
Use Osintgram v2 (beta)
You can use Osintgram2 beta just switching to v2 branch. The v2 has some improvements and is faster with a new command execution interface. Try it just running git checkout v2.

Docker Quick Start üê≥
This section will explain how you can quickly use this image with Docker or Docker-compose.

Prerequisites
Before you can use either Docker or Docker-compose, please ensure you do have the following prerequisites met.

Docker installed - link
Docker-composed installed (if using Docker-compose) - link
Credentials configured - This can be done manually or by running the make setup command from the root of this repo
Important: Your container will fail if you do not do step #3 and configure your credentials

Docker
If docker is installed you can build an image and run this as a container.

Build:

docker build -t osintgram .
Run:

docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD/output:/home/osintgram/output" osintgram <target>
The <target> is the Instagram account you wish to use as your target for recon.
The required -i flag enables an interactive terminal to use commands within the container. docs
The required -v flag mounts a volume between your local filesystem and the container to save to the ./output/ folder. docs
The optional --rm flag removes the container filesystem on completion to prevent cruft build-up. docs
The optional -t flag allocates a pseudo-TTY which allows colored output. docs
Using docker-compose
You can use the docker-compose.yml file this single command:

docker-compose run osintgram <target>
Where target is the Instagram target for recon.

Alternatively, you may run docker-compose with the Makefile:

make run - Builds and Runs with compose. Prompts for a target before running.

Makefile (easy mode)
For ease of use with Docker-compose, a Makefile has been provided.

Here is a sample work flow to spin up a container and run osintgram with just two commands!

make setup - Sets up your Instagram credentials
make run - Builds and Runs a osintgram container and prompts for a target
Sample workflow for development:

make setup - Sets up your Instagram credentials
make build-run-testing - Builds an Runs a container without invoking the main.py script. Useful for an it Docker session for development
make cleanup-testing - Cleans up the testing container created from build-run-testing
